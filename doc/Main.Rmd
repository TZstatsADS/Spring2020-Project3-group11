### Step 0 set work directories
```{r wkdir, eval=FALSE}
set.seed(0)
setwd("~/GitHub/Spring2020-Project3-group11/doc")
# here replace it with your own path or manually set it in RStudio to where this rmd file is located. 
# use relative path for reproducibility
```

Provide directories for training images. Training images and Training fiducial points will be in different subfolders. 
```{r}
train_dir <- "../data/train_set/" # This will be modified for different data sets.
train_image_dir <- paste(train_dir, "images/", sep="")
train_pt_dir <- paste(train_dir,  "points/", sep="")
train_label_path <- paste(train_dir, "label.csv", sep="") 
```

Source important functions, including train, test, cross_validation and tune.The pca function is a plus, we put the pca file into the lib, however, it may decrease the predicting accuracy. Therefore, source it as long as you may be interested in it.
```{r}
source("../lib/cross_validation.R")
source("../lib/train.R")
source("../lib/test.R")
source("../lib/tune.R")
source("../lib/feature.R")
source("../lib/pca.R")
source("../lib/kpca.R")
```


### Step 1: set up controls for evaluation experiments.

In this chunk, we have a set of controls for the evaluation experiments. 

+ (T/F) cross-validation on the training set
+ (number) K, the number of CV folds
+ (T/F) process distance feature for training set (the default is pairwise feature)
+ (T/F) conduct dimension reduction with pca method
+ (T/F) conduct dimension reduction with kpca method
+ (T/F) make prediction on an independent test set
+ (T/F) do tuning for selected methods

+ (T/F) do tuning on baseline model (the best parameters were plugged into train function as default)
+ (T/F) decide whether to train baseline model and to predict

+ (T/F) Change F to T if you want to train one of the models and predict

```{r exp_setup}
# overall control
run.cv = FALSE # run cross-validation on the training set
K = 5  # number of CV folds
run.feature = FALSE # process features (distance) for training set
run.pca = FALSE # dimension reduction with pca
run.kpca = FALSE # dimension reduction with kpca
run.test = TRUE # run evaluation on an independent test set
run.tune = FALSE #tune parameter

# baseline model control
run.baseline.tuning = FALSE #
run.baseline = FALSE #

# selected models (choose only one at a time)
run.gbm = FALSE   # baseline model
run.xgboost = FALSE
run.adaboost = FALSE
run.ksvm = FALSE
run.svm = TRUE
run.logistic = FALSE
```

Using cross-validation or independent test set evaluation, we compare the performance of models with different specifications. 
```{r model_setup}
# potential sets of parameters (for tuning)
shrinks_range <- c(0.01,0.05,0.1,0.15,0.2) #for gbm
trees_range  <- c(40,50,60,70,100) #for gbm
mfinal <- c(50, 75, 100, 125) # for adaboost
max_depth_values<-seq(3,9,2) #for xgboost
min_child_weight_values <- seq(1,6,2) #for xgboost
C <- c(1,5,10,20,50) # for ksvm
sigma <- c(0.0005,0.001,0.01,0.1,1) # for ksvm
cost <- c(0.00001,0.0001,0.001,0.01,0.1,1,5) # for svm
```

### Step 2: import data and train-test split 
```{r}
#train-test split
info <- read.csv(train_label_path)
n <- nrow(info)
n_train <- round(n*(4/5), 0)
train_idx <- sample(info$Index, n_train, replace = F)
test_idx <- setdiff(info$Index,train_idx)
```

If you choose to extract features from images, such as using Gabor filter, R memory will exhaust all images are read together. The solution is to repeat reading a smaller batch(e.g 100) and process them. 
```{r}
n_files <- length(list.files(train_image_dir))

image_list <- list()
for(i in 1:100){
   image_list[[i]] <- readImage(paste0(train_image_dir, sprintf("%04d", i), ".jpg"))
}
```

Fiducial points are stored in matlab format. In this step, we read them and store them in a list.
```{r read fiducial points, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#function to read fiducial points
#input: index
#output: matrix of fiducial points corresponding to the index
readMat.matrix <- function(index){
     return(round(readMat(paste0(train_pt_dir, sprintf("%04d", index), ".mat"))[[1]],0))
}

#load fiducial points
fiducial_pt_list <- lapply(1:n_files, readMat.matrix)
save(fiducial_pt_list, file="../output/fiducial_pt_list.RData")
```

### Step 3: construct features and responses

+ The follow plots show how pairwise distance between fiducial points can work as feature for facial emotion recognition.

  + In the first column, 78 fiducials points of each emotion are marked in order. 
  + In the second column distributions of vertical distance between right pupil(1) and  right brow peak(21) are shown in  histograms. For example, the distance of an angry face tends to be shorter than that of a surprised face.
  + The third column is the distributions of vertical distances between right mouth corner(50)
and the midpoint of the upper lip(52).  For example, the distance of an happy face tends to be shorter than that of a sad face.

![Figure1](../figs/feature_visualization.jpg)

`feature.R` should be the wrapper for all your feature engineering functions and options. The function `feature( )` should have options that correspond to different scenarios for your project and produces an R object that contains features and responses that are required by all the models you are going to evaluate later. 
  
  + `feature.R`
  + Input: list of images or fiducial point
  + Output: an RData file that contains extracted features and corresponding responses

```{r feature}
tm_feature_train <- NA
tm_feature_test <- NA
if(run.feature == FALSE){
  tm_feature_train <- system.time(da_train <- feature(fiducial_pt_list, train_idx))
  tm_feature_test <- system.time(da_test <- feature(fiducial_pt_list, test_idx))
}else{
  source("../lib/feature_distance.R")
  tm_feature_train <- system.time(da_train <- feature_dist(fiducial_pt_list, train_idx))
  tm_feature_test <- system.time(da_test <- feature_dist(fiducial_pt_list, test_idx))
}

save(da_train, file="../output/feature_train.RData")
save(da_test, file="../output/feature_test.RData")
```


```{r}
dat_train <- da_train[,-ncol(da_train)]
dat_test <- da_test[,-ncol(da_test)]
label_train <- da_train[,ncol(da_train)]
label_test <- da_test[,ncol(da_test)]
```


### Step 4: Train Baseline model
Call the train model and test model from library. 

`train.R` and `test.R` should be wrappers for all your model training steps and your classification/prediction steps. 

+ `train.R`
  + Input: a data frame containing features and labels and a parameter list.
  + Output:a trained model
+ `test.R`
  + Input: the fitted classification model using training data and processed features from testing images 
  + Input: an R object that contains a trained classifier.
  + Output: training model specification

+ In this Starter Code, we use KNN to do classification. 

#### Model selection with cross-validation

* Train the model with the entire training set using the selected model (model parameter) via cross-validation.

```{r cv_tuning}
if(run.baseline.tuning == T){
   par_best_baseline <- tune(dat_train ,label_train,
               run.gbm = T,
               run.xgboost = F,
               run.adaboost = F)
save(par_best_baseline,file = "par_best_baseline.RData")
print(par_best_baseline)
}
```

```{r final_train}
if(run.baseline == T){
  tm_train=NA
  tm_train <- system.time(fit_train <- train(dat_train, label_train, run.gbm = T))
  tm_test = NA
  tm_test <- system.time(fit_test <- test(fit_train, dat_test, run.gbm = T))
  error <- mean(fit_test != label_test)
}
```

* evaluation
```{r}
if(run.baseline == T){
  accu <- mean(label_test == fit_test)
  cat("The accuracy of model:", "is", accu*100, "%.\n")
}
```

Note that the accuracy is 43.4% after tuning wihle only 22% (before tuning) with default parameter settings in gbm function. 

### Step5: Potential Modified Models

#### tuning parameters for selected model
```{r}
if(run.tune == T){
  par_best <- tune(dat_train,
                 label_train,
                 run.xgboost = F,
                 run.adaboost = F,
                 run.ksvm = F,
                 run.svm = T,
                 run.logistic = F,
                 verbose = FALSE)
  save(par_best,file = "par_best.RData")
  print(par_best)
}
```

#### train model on training set and make prediction
```{r}
if(run.test == TRUE){
  tm_train=NA
  tm_train <- system.time(fit_train <- train(dat_train, 
                                             label_train,
                                             run.gbm = F,
                                             run.xgboost = F,       
                                             run.adaboost = F,      
                                             run.ksvm = F,
                                             run.svm = T,
                                             run.logistic = F))
  tm_test = NA
  tm_test <- system.time(fit_test <- test(fit.model, 
                                          dat_test,
                                          run.gbm = F,
                                          run.xgboost = F,       
                                          run.adaboost = F,      
                                          run.ksvm = F,
                                          run.svm = T,
                                          run.logistic = F))
  error <- mean(fit_test != label_test)
  accu <- mean(fit_test == label_test)
  cat("The accuracy of model:", "is", accu*100, "%.\n")
}
```


### Summarize Running Time
Prediction performance matters, so does the running times for constructing features and for training the model, especially when the computation resource is limited. 
```{r running_time}
cat("Time for constructing training features=", tm_feature_train[1], "s \n")
cat("Time for constructing testing features=", tm_feature_test[1], "s \n")
cat("Time for training model=", tm_train[1], "s \n")
cat("Time for testing model=", tm_test[1], "s \n")
```

### Save all intersted infomation in to excel
```{r}
t1 <- tibble(True_label = label_test,
             Predict_label = fit_test)
t2 <- tibble(Type = c("Time for constructing training features=",
                      "Time for constructing testing features=",
                      "Time for training model=",
                      "Time for testing model="),
             Time = c(tm_feature_train[1],
                      tm_feature_test[1],
                      tm_train[1],
                      tm_test[1]))
write_xlsx(list("Label"=t1,"Running_time"=t2),path = "../output/Result.xlsx")
```
